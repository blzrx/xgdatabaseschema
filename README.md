# XG Database Schema


This is my work doing a database reversal using the newest XG firewall feature that lets you encrypt and decrypt your own backup using a user-defined password, the work here is doing a database "relationship" of object, these objects are referenced by the Firewall Software over the GUI or the CLI to configure the device, the database used is PostgreSQL, since is your own backup, you can do everything you want.
